In order to assess this problem, first we need to understand colorblindness and later, pick one of the many forms this may manifest.
What is colorblindness? # Color blindness is classified according to the number of color channels that are available to a person to conveying color information into: monochromacy, dichromacy and anomalous trichromacy.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://andryut.github.io/showcase/docs/exercises/Depth-Perception/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andryut.github.io/showcase/docs/exercises/Depth-Perception/</guid><description>Parallax effect # Prompt: Take advantage of monocular cues to implement a 2D sketch to trick the eye into perceiving a 3D scene.
Here we have the parallax effect, tricking our eye into perceiving depth between objects in a 2-D plane.
Moon is following you at a slow speed and when the ball moves, the perspective of the buildings change.
On this sketch you can change the speed of the movement using left and right arrow keys.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://andryut.github.io/showcase/docs/exercises/Mach-Bands/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andryut.github.io/showcase/docs/exercises/Mach-Bands/</guid><description>Mach Bands # Prompt: Develop a terrain visualization application. Check out the 3D terrain generation with Perlin noise coding train tutorial.
Voronoi diagram.) # In mathematics, a Voronoi diagram is a partition of a plane into regions close to each of a given set of objects.
Implementation # In the following p5 sketch we mixed Perlin terrain generation, mach bands and voronoi diagrams.
First we create a set of random points in a plane, then we compute the voronoi diagram for this set of points using the gorhill javascript library.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://andryut.github.io/showcase/docs/exercises/Masking/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andryut.github.io/showcase/docs/exercises/Masking/</guid><description>Masking # Prompt: Implement a kinegram and some moir√© patterns which are close related visual phenomena to masking.
In the following image there are parallel lines in each row, but exists an illusion of a vertically displacement created by the irregular columns sort. The cafe wall illusion has been utilized by neuropsychologists to investigate how the brain processes visual information. Additionally, the illusion has found practical applications in graphic design and art.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://andryut.github.io/showcase/docs/exercises/Spatial-Coherence/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andryut.github.io/showcase/docs/exercises/Spatial-Coherence/</guid><description> Spatial Coherence # Prompt: Implement a pixelator video application and perform a benchmark of the results (color avg vs spatial coherence). How would you assess the visual quality of the results?
The color averaging filter works smoothing the image loosing the pictures details, otherwise, the spacial coherence technique achieves to keep details and shapes edges, this cant be done by color averaging smooth effect.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://andryut.github.io/showcase/docs/exercises/Visual-Illusions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andryut.github.io/showcase/docs/exercises/Visual-Illusions/</guid><description>Visual illusions # Prompt: Study, implement and discuss possible applications of some known visual phenomena and optical illusions.
The Hermann grid is used to create the optical illusion of perceiving a ghost between the grid cells, it&amp;rsquo;s produced a neural process called &amp;ldquo;Lateral inhibition&amp;rdquo;. In the image there are only white spaces and black blocks but the eyes perceive some kind of contrasts creating &amp;ldquo;gosthlike&amp;rdquo; shapes.
