# Spatial Coherence
>**Prompt:** Implement a pixelator video application and perform a benchmark of the results (color avg vs spatial coherence). How would you assess the visual quality of the results?
>

The color averaging filter works smoothing the image loosing the pictures details, otherwise, the spacial coherence technique achieves to keep 
details and shapes edges, this cant be done by color averaging smooth effect.
